# neve-install-scripts

This is a collection of scripts to aid installation of Neve Linux.

It is inspired by (but not based on) `arch-install-scripts` and
forked from `chimera-install-scripts`.

## Dependencies

* Any Linux system with a GNU or BSD core userland
* Portions of `util-linux` (`findmnt`, `mount`)
